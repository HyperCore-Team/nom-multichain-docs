# Core Contracts

The **Core Contracts** are one of the most important elements of the NoM Multi-chain infrastructure. They are deployed on NoM - the bridge embedded contract and each network that will participate in the multi-chain infrastructure. They are the primary infrastructure contracts, which the Orchestrator Nodes observe and which fundamentally enable the cross-chain communication. In general, Core Contracts have a similar structure and can be broken down to a receiving side, which we'll define later.

There are **Core Contracts** on each network that is part of the ecosystem, with the **Orchestrator Layer** acting as a global observer of inter-network events.
