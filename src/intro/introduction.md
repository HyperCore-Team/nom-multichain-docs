# Introduction

The **Network of Momentum Multi-chain Infrastructure** is an interoperability solution dedicated for the development of a sustainable, thriving ecosystem. Users are able to frictionlessly swap NoM assets between different blockchain networks through a seamless procedure enabled by user-friendly interfaces. This integration with the wider blockchain ecosystem will simultaneously attract more users (builders, developers, marketers, liquidity providers, etc.) and will also unlock a core component of the Network of Momentum: the Protocol Level Liquidity.

This documentation is intended to provide users and developers all the necessary information to interact, develop and maintain the Network of Momentum Multi-chain Infrastructure:

* **The Decentralized Bridge** to *wrap* and *unwrap* native NoM assets
* **The Protocol Level Liquidity** that enables the *Orbital Program*

Both components are covered in the Zenon Improvement Proposal `ZIP:sumamu-0001`. The complete ZIP can be found [here](https://forum.zenon.org/t/zip-sumamu-0001-draft/1327).
