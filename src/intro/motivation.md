# Motivation

One of the most important elements of a decentralized network is represented by its interoperability with the wider ecosystem. The unconfined flow of assets between NoM and other blockchain networks will unlock a new network participant in NoM as first-class citizen - the LP provider and boost the ecosystem in terms of user base, network activity, use-cases, etc.

Furthermore, in order to achieve protocol level liquidity and successfully kickstart the Orbital Program, a bidirectional mechanism to allow the flow of assets between NoM and other blockchain networks is required.

## Centralized exchanges issues

Current centralized exchanges (CEX) are single point of failures by either going rogue (e.g. FTX saga), shutting down due to regulatory pressures, or simply hacked and user funds drained (e.g. QuadrigaCX). Moreover, centralized exchanges have several other limitations and weaknesses:

* KYC mishandling and user account censorship
* Cumbersome listing procedures or requirements
* Prohibitive listing fees
* Manipulative behavior (e.g. wash trading)
* Delistings due to regulatory pressure
* Poor API security
* Opaque order book

## Decentralized alternatives

Decentralized exchanges (DEX) and liquidity pool-based automated market makers (AMM) (e.g. Synapse, Multichain, cBridge, Uniswap, Pancakeswap, etc.) are better suited for trustlessly swapping assets within or between blockchain ecosystems: a frictionless, user-centric approach that benefits every participant.

In order to fulfill the vision of a decentralized ecosystem, a robust multi-chain interoperability solution is crucial to be deployed and maintained at protocol level with a layered security approach.

## Protocol Level Liquidity

Protocol Level Liquidity is a way to incentivize liquidity providers by allocating and distributing funds for them directly from the network emission in a trustlessly and automated manner. NoM has a dual-coin inflation in ZNN (Zenon) and QSR (Quasar). A fraction of this dual-coin emission is reserved for the liquidity embedded, a system smart contract that is currently tasked to safely store it for the upcoming Orbital Program.
